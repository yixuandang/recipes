Ingredients:
 - 1/4 cup vegetable oil
 - 8 cloves garlic, smashed
 - 1 large onion, chopped
 - 8 thin slices ginger
 - 1 pound sliced bacon
 - 4 pounds chicken wings
 - 12 dried shiitake mushrooms, rinsed
 - 12 scallions, white and light green parts chopped
 - 1/4 cup sake or dry sherry
 - 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
 - Kosher salt
 - 1 teaspoon sugar
 - 1 teaspoon white peppercorns
 - 3-to-5-ounce packages dry or vacuum-packed ramen noodles(flavor packets discarded)

Directions:
 1. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is dark brown, about 30 minutes.
 
 2. Meanwhile, make the broth: Put the bacon and chicken wings in a Dutch oven and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer 10 minutes. Drain and wipe the pot clean. Rinse the bacon and wings under cold water, then return to the pot; add 4 quarts water and the dried mushrooms. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium; add the garlic mixture and gently simmer 1 hour, 15 minutes.
 
 3. Strain the broth through a colander into a large bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much of the liquid as possible. Skim any excess fat from the surface. Measure the broth, adding water if necessary to yield 2 quarts. (The broth can be made up to 4 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.)

 4. Just before serving, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and the scallions in a medium skillet over medium heat until the mixture starts sizzling. Add the sake, soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, the sugar, peppercorns and 1/2 cup water. Simmer, reducing to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes.

 5. Bring the broth and the scallion mixture to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the noodles and cook until softened, 1 to 3 minutes. Gently pull the noodles apart with tongs. Transfer the soup to bowls and top as desired.
